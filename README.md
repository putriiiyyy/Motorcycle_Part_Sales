# Motorcycle Part Sales
This is my SQL + Tableau project on motorcycle parts sales data. I built it from scratch to practice end-to-end data handling, cleaning, SQL business analysis, and Tableau interactive dashboard.  The focus of this project is on wholesale orders, where I calculate net revenue and analyze results by product line, warehouse, and month.
