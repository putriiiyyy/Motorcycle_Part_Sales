# Motorcycle Part Sales
This is my SQL + Tableau project on motorcycle parts sales data. I built it from scratch to practice end-to-end data handling, cleaning, SQL business analysis, and Tableau interactive dashboard.  The focus of this project is on wholesale orders, where I calculate net revenue and analyze results by product line, warehouse, and month. 

# 📌 Project Overview
The company operates three warehouses, selling motorcycle parts through both retail and wholesale channels. Customers can pay with credit card, cash, or bank transfer, with each method incurring different transaction fees. The board of directors requested insights into wholesale performance, focusing on net revenue (sales total minus payment fees). This project answers:
1. How wholesale net revenue varies by product line
2. Month-to-month revenue trends
3. Performance differences across warehouses

# 🛠 Tools Used
- SQL → for querying, grouping, and calculating net revenue
- Tableau Public → for interactive dashboards and visualization
